  hi: "Hi. Welcome to Tubet, Kenyaâ€™s 1st Fantasy betting game for the Premier League with real world odds. My name is Lyne, I'm here to help you.",
  diclaimer: "Ground rules first. Before we continue I need to make sure you are aware of the following. \r\n\r\n 1. You are over 18 years old. \r\n 2. You understand that this is not a betting service. \r\n 3. You agree that this only a fantasy game and any odds or suggested winnings are not guaranteed.",
  prompt: "Do you agree with the Terms and Conditions?",
  termsRejected: "Sorry, I can't continue until you accept the terms and conditions.",
  termsAccepted: 'Cool. Lets get started.',
  personalization: 'Lets get to know each other a bit. First, what team currently playing the Premier League do you support?',
  teamSelected: "Nice, now we can get started.",
  teamNotFound: "Sorry, I wasn't able to find the team ",
  teamTryAgain: "Please check and make sure they are playing in the League this season, or try the full name of the team. For example, I'm a fan of the Reds so I would reply with Liverpool.",
  bettingIntro: "Let me explain a little about how betting works, by explaining some of the terms.",
  explainerBet: "Sports betting works by you predicting how a match between two teams will end and placing some money. If you predict the right result, you will win the amount you bet multiplied by the Odds. What is the odds you say?",
  explainerOdds: "Odds tell you how much money you will make if you predict the correct result. They can be expressed as a ratio e.g. 8:1 or 8 to 1, or a single number like 2.33.",
  explainerOddsExample: "We'll use single numbers here for each outcome. For example, a match between Liverpool and Everton the odds of a Liverpool win are 2.25, for Everton to win the odds are 3.25 and 4.10 for a draw. What result is more likely to happen?",
  exampleCorrect: "Yes, that's right!",
  exampleWrong: "Sorry, the more likely outcome is a Liverpool win",
  exampleExplainer: "The higher the odds, the lower the chances for it to happen. The lower the odds the higher the chances for it to happen. In football terms, the Favorite team typically has lower odds to win than the underdog team. Lets talk a bit about the earnings.",
  creditsExplainer: "Instead of real money, we use credits in this game. Say for example if you had bet 100 credits on Liverpool to win at 2.25 and you were correct, how many credits will you have won?",
  exampleResultsCorrect: "Yes, 225 cool credits.",
  exampleResultsWrong: "Sorry, the right answer is 225",
  exampleResultsExplainer: "If you pick the right result, your winnings are calculated by multiplying your bet by the odds, so 100 x 2.25.",
  startingCredits: "That was easy. I think you are now ready to start playing. I'll start you off with 100 free credits.",
  goodLuck: "Last weeks games are all done, so I'll let you know as soon as the odds are ready for this week",
  waiting: "Mmh, I'm still preparing the odds for this week. You'll be the first to know soon as they are ready"
